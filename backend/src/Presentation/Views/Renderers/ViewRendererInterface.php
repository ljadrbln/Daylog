 * Contract for all view renderers (HTML, JSON, etc.).

 * Provide a minimal, stable API for the Presentation layer to render
 * a final HTTP body as a string. Concrete implementations are responsible
 * for applying headers (e.g., Content-Type, status) and formatting.
 *
 * Mechanics:
 * - Controllers (via ViewResponse) pass a normalized payload array.
 * - Implementations (e.g., HtmlView, JsonView) set headers internally
 *   and return the rendered body.

     * (status code, Content-Type) before producing the body.
     * Payload is expected to be a normalized, presentation-ready array.
     *
     * @param array<string,mixed> $payload Normalized payload prepared by the controller/ViewResponse.

     * @return string Rendered HTTP body (ready to echo).
