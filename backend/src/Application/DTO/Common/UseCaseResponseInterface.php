 * Base contract for all Use Case response DTOs.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * Provide a unified serialization method for Application â†’ Presentation handoff.
 * Every use case response implements this contract so that Presentation can
 * safely call toArray() and receive a predictable associative payload.
 *
 * Mechanics:
 * - Implementations define the exact shape of the payload via PHPStan @implements.
 * - Implementations MUST expose toArray(), returning only scalars/arrays
 *   (no domain entities or transport details).
 *
 * @template TPayload of array<string, mixed>
